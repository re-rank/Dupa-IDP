# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Project Atlas is an open-source tool that automatically analyzes single or multi-repository codebases to visualize frontend, backend, database, and API structures along with their dependencies and interconnections. The tool aims to help developers and operators quickly understand complex project architectures through automated analysis and intuitive visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Git-based Project Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically analyze my Git repository structure, so that I can understand the project composition without manual documentation review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Git repository is provided THEN the system SHALL identify and categorize folder structures by type (frontend, backend, db, config, api, .env)
2. WHEN analyzing project files THEN the system SHALL automatically detect programming languages and frameworks (React, Vue, Django, Express, etc.)
3. WHEN scanning the repository THEN the system SHALL parse configuration files to extract project metadata
4. IF multiple repositories are provided THEN the system SHALL analyze each repository independently and identify cross-repository relationships

### Requirement 2: Service Dependency Extraction

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to automatically extract service dependencies and API calls, so that I can understand the interconnection patterns without manually tracing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing source code THEN the system SHALL identify API calls using common HTTP clients (fetch, axios, requests, httpClient)
2. WHEN examining database connections THEN the system SHALL detect ORM configurations and SQL query patterns
3. WHEN processing configuration files THEN the system SHALL extract environment variables and port information
4. WHEN analyzing service calls THEN the system SHALL map the direction and type of each dependency relationship

### Requirement 3: Interactive Visualization Interface

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to view service relationships through interactive diagrams, so that I can quickly communicate architecture to stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display service interconnection graphs with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN viewing the visualization THEN the system SHALL show API flow diagrams and database access patterns
3. WHEN interacting with the diagram THEN the system SHALL allow users to zoom, pan, and filter components
4. WHEN clicking on components THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about selected services or connections

### Requirement 4: Automated Component Reporting

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to receive comprehensive reports about project components, so that I can track technology usage and team responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate a list of all detected APIs with their endpoints
2. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL provide framework and language usage statistics
3. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL include service ownership information where available
4. WHEN exporting reports THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)

### Requirement 5: Multi-Repository Support

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to analyze multiple related repositories simultaneously, so that I can understand the complete microservices architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple repositories are specified THEN the system SHALL analyze each repository's structure independently
2. WHEN cross-repository dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL identify and visualize inter-service communications
3. WHEN displaying multi-repo results THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between internal and external service calls
4. IF repositories have shared dependencies THEN the system SHALL highlight common components and libraries

### Requirement 6: Framework and Language Detection

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want automatic detection of technologies used across projects, so that I can assess technical debt and standardization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning JavaScript projects THEN the system SHALL identify React, Vue, Angular, and Node.js frameworks
2. WHEN analyzing Python code THEN the system SHALL detect Django, Flask, FastAPI, and other web frameworks
3. WHEN examining configuration files THEN the system SHALL identify build tools, package managers, and deployment configurations
4. WHEN multiple technologies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for each identification

### Requirement 7: Export and Integration Capabilities

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to export visualization results, so that I can include them in project documentation and presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting diagrams THEN the system SHALL support common image formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable formats (JSON, YAML)
3. WHEN integrating with external tools THEN the system SHALL offer API endpoints for programmatic access
4. IF version control integration is needed THEN the system SHALL support webhook-based automatic re-analysis

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the analysis to complete efficiently on large codebases, so that I can use the tool on enterprise-scale projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing repositories with over 10,000 files THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 5 minutes
2. WHEN processing multiple repositories THEN the system SHALL support parallel analysis execution
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement streaming analysis for large codebases
4. IF analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and partial results where possible
